2. **Modern Architecture**: Refactored using the React Native framework, ensuring better maintainability and performance.
3. **Updated Libraries**: Migrated to the latest React Native and associated dependencies.
4. **Modular Components**: Components structured for readability and reusability.
5. **Improved Testing**: Includes Jest-based unit tests with GitHub Actions integration.
